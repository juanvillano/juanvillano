### Hi I'm Juan Villar ðŸ‘‹

I have more than 9 years of experience. During the first 5 years of my career I worked in an advertising agency as a graphic and motion designer, after that I started designing for the web. In the last 5 years I've been working as an UX designer for agencies and finantial intitutions.
